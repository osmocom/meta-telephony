# OS#4062: Some gcc version (< 7.3.0) on ARM generate wrong code for __thread
# variables that crash at runtime. It seems, due to some unknown reason, that we
# are not affected by this bug with toolchain from poky pyro (6.4.0). However,
# libosmocore as of e188b8cd98f599468fbb200c7d590de955daf761 applies some
# CFLAGS="-mtls-dialect=gnu2" to workaround the issue automatically. But same
# toolchain contains an "ld" that crashes when those flags are applied.
# Fortunately, libosmocore provides a way to disable the workaround, and since
# we are not affected by the bug, we are fine with that. If the toolchain had
# the TLS runtime bug, then we'd had to build with -O0. Can be probably dropped
# once we move to newer toolchain.
